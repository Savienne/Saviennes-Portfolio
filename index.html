        <header>General Assembly: Where It All Began</header>
        <!-- <h1> About Me! <p>Hi ! Im Savienne Mitchell. Welcome to my portfolio!  I started my journey as a software developer about 8 years ago, when I began working for the telecom company Sprint.  Through the years, I worked my way up to assistant manager. I had a wonderful time managing the sales floor, working with people and customers, and really grew to love the troubleshooting-problem solving role I grew into. Along the way, Ive made incredible friends/associates/work relationships that will stick with me for life. On my 6th year, in 2020, covid happened and sprint was purchased by T-mobile. Many of the changes were incredible, and the people I worked for and with were extremely refreshing and eye opening. Watching the advancements of technology (especially over the last 2 years) really inspired me to utilize my problem solving skills, people skills, and love for technology on a new level.  Software development has become more than another language to me, but a way of life with an AMAZING community. So, if you have time, let's talk tech!</p></h1> -->

              <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
