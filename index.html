        <header>General Assembly: Where It All Began</header>
        <h1> About Me! <p>Hi ! Im Savienne Mitchell. Welcome to my portfolio!  I started my journey as a software developer about 8 years ago, when I began working for the telecom company Sprint.  Through the years, I worked my way up to assistant manager. I had a wonderful time managing the sales floor, working with people and customers, and really grew to love the troubleshooting-problem solving role I grew into. Along the way, Ive made incredible friends/associates/work relationships that will stick with me for life. On my 6th year, in 2020, covid happened and sprint was purchased by T-mobile. Many of the changes were incredible, and the people I worked for and with were extremely refreshing and eye opening. Watching the advancements of technology (especially over the last 2 years) really inspired me to utilize my problem solving skills, people skills, and love for technology on a new level.  Software development has become more than another language to me, but a way of life with an AMAZING community. So, if you have time, let's talk tech!</p></h1>
