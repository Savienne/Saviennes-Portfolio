# Saviennes-Portfolio
This Portfolio is a display of my journey entering into the Software Engineering world.
Enjoy getting to know me through my work. Here, you can find multiple forms of contact for me, play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe with someone, and view alittle of how I have learned to code. Also, for your listening/viewing pleasure, I have added a photo of my FAVOURITE bird, a Blue-Jay, that plays birds singing when you click it. I have also included a link to my schools website, in case you want to know more about it! For those with senstive eyes, there is also a button label that when clicked switches between light and dark mode.

What are you waiting for? Come see for yourself! (Click link below)
